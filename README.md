This repo merely serves as a basic introduction to the DEPA framework. Unlike the other repos which lay out design requirements for various pieces of software, this repo merely serves to give a newcomer some basic information about DEPA. Unlike the other repos, no code is meant to be committed here. 




**What is DEPA?**

DEPA stands for Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture. It is a set of open APIs intended to facilitate secure data sharing in the economy, beginning with the financial sector. 




**What is data empowerment? What is data protection?**

Data empowerment: in today's world, the companies which hold our data derive all of the value from it. They make it hard to export this data because it creates a moat for them. If it becomes easier for customers to move data outside these silos, they can become empowered to use the data to secure more choice, better pricing, and better service. 

Data protection: customers today often don't have much control or visibility over how their data is stored or shared. You've probably received loads of emails, SMSs, and phone calls from random numbers because your details have been shared as part of customer databases. Data protection is about giving users control over their data so that their data flows only with explicit consent. Users must be able to decide who stores their data, for how long, for what purpose, under what terms. Users must also be able to share granular data eg. "instead of sharing my entire bank statement, only share my transactions with Swiggy which were <Rs.500".



**Why do we need data protection and empowerment? Why are they important in the financial sector?**

Data protection and empowerment are both important trends of the new decade. Privacy and data security have become pressing issues due to both consumer demand (spurred on by documentaries like The Great Hack, as well as by high profile data breaches like Equifax, Facebook) and regulator pressure (with initiatives like GDPR). In the earlier phases of the Internet, data protection and privacy were eschewed in favour of rapid growth. Now, consumers, businesses, and governments are wisening up to the fact that data is an important asset that must be protected and made use of.

This is doubly true for financial data, especially in a place like India. Although around 400m Indians have bank accounts, most of these accounts are underutilized. Proportional to the population, very few Indians have ever availed of credit, savings, or insurance products. These products, which boost financial health and stability, could be life-changing for Indian customers. The problem is that in the absence of good data, it is difficult to underwrite customers or prescribe them the right product. Therefore, it is imperative for Indian consumers to understand that by generating financial data and sharing it with the right partner, they can improve their lives.  It is also important that the data sharing process is secure, transparent, and cheap. Lowering the cost of sharing data will allow lenders and insurers to create more low-ticket products that can serve lower-income demographics. This is why DEPA is so important and why it is first being rolled out across the financial sector.




**Wait do you mean it will be rolled out across other sectors too?**

Yes, in time the DEPA framework will be adopted across the economy. Healthcare, telecom, social media, consumer internet - companies and institutions from all of these sectors will eventually be able to adopt a DEPA style framework to allow for consensual and secure data sharing. The legal framework supporting this is [India's Personal Data Protection Bill](https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Personal_Data_Protection_Bill,2018.pdf)



**So what are some timelines here?**

The DEPA rollout for banks and financial institutions have begun. SBI, HDFC, ICICI, Bajaj Finance, Kotak Bank - these are just a few of the companies which have begun implementing the APIs. A developer launch for the system should happen sometime within the next two months, and a full citizen launch should happen within 6 months.



**What is the role of the open source community?**

This project is extremely important for the country, and it has been designed to be open and easy for developers because we believe in the power of open source communities. We want the community to work on putting out high quality open source software which can accelerate the adoption of this impactful system. Some of the projects we have envisioned are described in greater detail in the other repos on this page.
